# DND Headlines

A Flutter rewrite of the DND Headlines Android app.

DND Headlines is a news-feeder app that fetches top news stories from an open source back-end/API, News API, for a certain news source, and then displays the extracted news data onto a list UI (where each item is clickable to then display the respective news story within a web view widget).

A couple of design implementations to note (including, but not limited to):
- Integrates the News API Dart package within the client to allow getting JSON-decoded data
- Integrates the Firebase plug-in natively for both Android and iOS for storing/retrieving secure strings such as an API key
- Applies a native approach for handling JSON serialization
- Uses Dartâ€™s native async/await for a Future to allow multi-threading
- Implements Flutter widgets accordingly to output a functional news app

Here are some screenshots of my debugging progress so far:

- Landing screen which displays the top 10 headlines for the selected news source via the list view widget:

- Uses a third-party Flutter picker package to select a news source (where the list of options are deserialized from a static JSON file):

- Renders the deserialized news source URL data to populate onto a web view widget:
